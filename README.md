# Local Web Service for Dynamic Event Booking: A Practical, Application-Oriented Solution
This project provides a local web service that enables dynamic, calendar-based event booking with limited capacity. Designed to support organized registration for events where seat availability is restricted, this system targets organizations that lack automated reservation systems.

## Background
Organizations like Rosatom often face significant challenges in creating and managing reservation forms for various events. Currently, a new form must be created manually for each event, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. This project offers a robust and reusable solution to streamline this process, making it beneficial for a broad range of organizations.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed system offers the following functionalities:

## Customizable Reservation Forms
Administrators can create unique reservation forms for events with customizable dates, start times, and capacity limits via an administrative dashboard.

## Automatic Capacity Management
Automatically restricts further bookings when the capacity is reached, ensuring no overbooking.

## Concurrency Control
Built-in checks prevent overbooking by handling simultaneous bookings for the same time slot.

## User-Friendly Booking Forms
For each event, a user-facing booking form is generated, allowing participants to sign up by filling out custom fields defined by the event organizer.
